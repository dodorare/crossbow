# Crossbow iOS Platform

## About

This folder contains the Objective-C and Rust code for the iOS platform port, using [Cargo](https://crates.io/) as a build system. Used by the [crossbow](../../).

You will probably want to use the top level [crossbow](../../) crate in your game.

## WARNING

Crossbow iOS is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change. Essential features are missing, and documentation is sparse. Please don't build any serious projects with Crossbow iOS unless you are prepared to be broken by API changes constantly.

## Thanks and inspiration

This project was inspired by the [Godot iOS](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/platform/ios) platform implementation, give them a star if you like ;)
