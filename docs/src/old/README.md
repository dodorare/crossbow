**Welcome to Crossbow wiki!** The primary purpose of this documentation is to help developers set up the environment for convenient mobile development with our utility. Depending on your platform, you can select the section (Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker).

Our tool requires **Xcode** or **Android Studio** to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

Installation tutorials are available here:

|**Windows**|**MacOS** |**Linux**|**Docker**|

Tutorials on how to create and configure the project with `crossbow` you can find here: [Project Configuration](./main-project-configuration.md), [Hello-World](./main-hello-world.md).

Testing guide is available here: [Testing Guide](./testing-guide.md).
