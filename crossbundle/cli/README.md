# üèπ CrossBundle CLI

![splash](https://github.com/dodorare/crossbow/blob/main/.github/assets/splash.png?raw=true)

The **crossbundle** is a command-line tool that encapsulates boring stuff of **Android** and **iOS** build/packaging processes and helps mobile developers to create and maintain applications written in **rust** programming language.

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Support status

Packaging status:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| Android APK | Default build result method. | ‚úÖ |
| Android AAB | Supported via `--aab` flag. | ‚úÖ |
| Apple Debug IPA | Default build result method. Works only on Simulator and could be run on iPhone with Dev Certificate. | üÜó |
| Apple Release IPA | Not supported yet. Crossbundle should generate `xcodeproj`, but user should build and sign IPA manually. | üõ† |

Game engines supported:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) | Default build method. Injects [ndk-glue](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/tree/master/ndk-glue) into generated tmp `lib.rs` file. | ‚úÖ |
| [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) | Supported via `--quad` flag. Works as [cargo-quad-apk](https://github.com/not-fl3/cargo-quad-apk) but with all `crossbundle` features. | ‚úÖ |

P.S: If you don't find your engine here, open an issue! We are happy to add support for new engines.

‚úÖ = Works and tested ‚Äî üÜó = Works but may contain bugs ‚Äî üõ† = Under development

## üåÄ Installation

```sh
cargo install --git=https://github.com/dodorare/crossbow crossbundle
```

See [installation documentation](../../docs/README.md) for more details on how to setup environment on your platform.

---

**_NOTE_**

For the correct work of the tool, you need to set up a development environment (ex. install some libraries and tools - such as Android SDK, Android NDK, XCode, etc).
More information about how to set up the environment in the **Android setup** and **iOS setup** wiki pages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Cargo.toml Metadata syntax

```toml
# The user-friendly application name for your app. Displayed in the applications menu
app_name = "Example"
# The version number shown to users
version_name = "0.1.0"
# Internal version number used to determine whether one version is more recent than another
# See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element
version_code = 1
# Min SDK version
min_sdk_version = 21
# Target SDK version
target_sdk_version = 30
# Max SDK version
max_sdk_version = 31
# Virtual path your application's icon as mipmap resource.
icon = "ic_launcher"

# Use Android.manifest file or generate from Cargo.toml
use_android_manifest = true
# Path to Android.manifest file
android_manifest_path = "path/to/AndroidManifest.xml"

# Use Info.plist file or generate from Cargo.toml
use_info_plist = true
# Path to Info.plist file
info_plist_path = "path/to/Info.plist"

# Android package to place in AndroidManifest.xml.
android_package = "com.example.ExampleProject"
# Android resources directory path relatively to project path.
android_res = "res/android"
# Android assets directory path relatively to project path.
android_assets = "assets"
# Android build targets.
android_build_targets = ["aarch64-linux-android"]

# Apple build targets.
apple_build_targets = ["aarch64-apple-ios", "x86_64-apple-ios"]
# Apple resources directory path relatively to project path.
apple_res = "res/apple"
# Apple assets directory path relatively to project path.
apple_assets = "assets"

# Adds a uses-permission element to the AndroidManifest.xml.
# Note that android_version 23 and higher, Android requires the application to request permissions at runtime.
[[package.metadata.android_permissions]]
name = "android.permission.INTERNET"
max_sdk_version = 21

## üéè CLI options and flags

To see the complete documentation for each command/subcommand you can write `-h` or `--help`:

```sh
crossbundle -h
crossbundle build android -h
crossbundle run apple -h
crossbundle install -h
# ...
```

Result of `crossbundle -h`:

    help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    install    Installs bundletool and Android Studio's sdkmanager
    log        Attach logger to device with running application

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Shared library "<lib_name>" not found

If you ran into problem of missing shared library in the `apk/aab` - you can fix this by placing your `.so` file into `target/<rust-triple>/<profile>/tools/libname.so`. The builder will pick the library up and put it in the final package.
