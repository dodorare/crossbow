# Crossbow Android Platform

## About

This folder contains the Java and Rust (JNI) code for the Android platform port, using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Cargo](https://crates.io/) as a build systems. Used by the [crossbow](../../).

You will probably want to use the top level [crossbow](../../) crate in your game.

## WARNING

Crossbow Android is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change. Essential features are missing, and documentation is sparse. Please don't build any serious projects with Crossbow Android unless you are prepared to be broken by API changes constantly.

## Crossbow Android plugins

For more information on how to write custom Crossbow Android plugins see this [tutorial](../../docs/crossbow-plugin.md).

## Thanks and inspiration

This project was inspired by the [Godot Android](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/platform/android) platform implementation, give them a star if you like ;)
