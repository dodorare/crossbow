# Testing guide

## How to run tests in crossbow

In `crossbow`, we have unit tests, integration tests, and examples. To run tests, you will need to set up an **Android** and **Apple** environment (you can find more information in [installation category](../install/README.md)).

If you want to run tests for our `crossbundle` crate, you can make it by the following steps: download this repository, proceed to the `crossbundle/tools` directory, and run `cargo test`. It will run all tests for the `crossbundle-tools` crate that is primarily used by `crossbundle`.

## In case of issues

Feel free to open [Github Issues](https://github.com/dodorare/crossbow/issues/new/choose) - we will be happy to fix or review them.
