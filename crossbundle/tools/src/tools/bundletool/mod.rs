/// ## Bundletool
/// `bundletool` is the underlying tool that Android Studio, the Android Gradle plugin,
/// and Google Play use to build an Android App Bundle, and convert an app bundle into
/// the various APKs that are deployed to devices. bundletool is also available to you
/// as a command line tool, so you can build app bundles yourself and recreate
/// Google Play’s server-side build of your app’s APKs.
///
///
/// ## Download bundletool
/// If you haven't already done so, download bundletool from the [`GitHub repository`].
///
///
/// ## Install bundletool
/// In variable environments needs to create new variable BUNDLETOOL_PATH and add
/// path to the bundletool
///
/// [`GitHub repository`]::https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases
