# üèπ CrossBundle CLI

![splash](https://github.com/dodorare/crossbow/blob/main/.github/assets/splash.png?raw=true)

The **crossbundle** is a command-line tool that encapsulates boring stuff of **Android** and **iOS** build/packaging processes and helps mobile developers to create and maintain applications written in **rust** programming language.

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Support status

Packaging status:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| Android APK | Default build result method. | ‚úÖ |
| Android AAB | Supported via `--aab` flag. | ‚úÖ |
| Apple Debug IPA | Default build result method. Works only on Simulator and could be run on iPhone with Dev Certificate. | üÜó |
| Apple Release IPA | Not supported yet. Crossbundle should generate `xcodeproj`, but user should build and sign IPA manually. | üõ† |

Supported game engines:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) | Default build method. Injects [ndk-glue](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/tree/master/ndk-glue) into generated tmp `lib.rs` file. | üÜó |
| [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) | Supported via `--quad` flag. Works as [cargo-quad-apk](https://github.com/not-fl3/cargo-quad-apk) but with all `crossbundle` features. | ‚úÖ |
| **placeholder** | Don't find your game engine here? Open an issue! We are happy to add support for new engines. | üõ† |

‚úÖ = Works and tested ‚Äî üÜó = Works but may contain bugs ‚Äî üõ† = Under development

## üåÄ Installation

```sh
cargo install --git=https://github.com/dodorare/crossbow crossbundle
```

See [installation documentation](../../docs/README.md) for more details on how to setup environment on your platform.

---

**_NOTE_**

For the correct work of the tool, you need to set up a development environment (ex. install some libraries and tools - such as Android SDK, Android NDK, XCode, etc).
More information about how to set up the environment in the **Android setup** and **iOS setup** wiki pages.

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Shared library "<lib_name>" not found

If you ran into problem of missing shared library in the `apk/aab` - you can fix this by placing your `.so` file into `target/<rust-triple>/<profile>/tools/libname.so`. The builder will pick the library up and put it in the final package.
